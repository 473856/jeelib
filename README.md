About  {#index}
=====

**JeeLib** is an Arduino [IDE][1] library for the "ports" on [JeeNodes][2], the  
RF12.h wireless driver library, timers, low-power code, and several interface  
classes. With examples for many sensor & interface boards made by [JeeLabs][3].

The latest source code for this project is maintained on [GitHub][6].  
You can download all the project source files in [ZIP][4] or [TAR][5] format:  

* Unpack the archive and rename the resulting folder to "JeeLib".
* Move it to the "libraries" folder in your Arduino sketches area.
* Restart the Arduino IDE to make sure it sees the new files.

The wiki for this library is at <http://jeelabs.net/projects/cafe/wiki>.

The documentation (generated by [Doxygen][7]) can be found [here][8].
